# Computex
Computex is a distributed compute platform that aims to allow users to offload computational tasks to a decentralised network using a simple CLI, validated by a Move smart contract. 
It allows users to distributed large scale compuation/rendering workloads across CPUs and GPUs on the network and rewards a user on successful completion of task.

Current Build status : Unsuccessful

A user can register their machine on the network using their wallet, and then delegate compute tasks(CUDA operations for Nvidia GPUs) to other machines registered 
on the network using commandline interface .

Usage:

No current usage due to unsuccessful build
